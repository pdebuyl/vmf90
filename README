vmf90 : Vlasov solver for mean-field systems in Fortran 90
==========================================================

Copyright Â© 2009-2011 Pierre de Buyl

vmf90 is a software for the numerical resolution of the Vlasov equation for 
mean-field systems, such as the Hamiltonian Mean-Field model. vmf90 is based
on the semi-Lagrangian method with cubic spline interpolation.

vmf90 is developed by Pierre de Buyl and is available under the `GNU General 
Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_. The GNU General Public
License is found in the file LICENSE. The homepage for vmf90 is
`<http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~pdebuyl/vmf90/>`_.

At this time, the vmf90 program is available only for the HMF model.

Requirements
------------

* A Fortran 95 compiler.
* The `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ library.

To analyze the data, Python example scripts are provided. They require

* `Python <http://python.org/>`_.
* The `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ library.
* The `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ library.
* The `h5py <http://h5py.alfven.org>`_ library.

Usage
-----

1. Make sure that the ``h5fc`` Fortran compiler script for HDF5 is properly set up.
2. run the make command with the HMF argument ::

    make HMF


3. The build directory now contains an executable runHMF.
4. A ``HMF_in`` configuration file is required to set up the
   simulation. Examples are found in the ``examples`` directory.
5. After a run is completed, the data is found in the file ``hmf.h5``. Examples
   scripts on how to read these files in Python are found in the ``scripts``
   directory.

Documentation
-------------

A doxygen-generated documentation is readily available by executing ::

    doxygen doc/doxy_conf

from the main directory of vmf90.

This README file is reStructuredText and can be converted to html, for instance,
with the rst2html command-line tool ::

    rst2html README > README.html

Appropriate references to the algorithms are given in the documentation, as well
a full API documentation for the code and the Fortran modules.

Appropriate citation is appreciated in any scientific publication that makes use
of this software. The latest citation suggestion is ::
